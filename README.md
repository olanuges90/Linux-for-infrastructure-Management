# Building Secure and Efficient Systems: “Leveraging Linux for infrastructure Management”

# Overview
This project focuses on utilizing Linux to build secure, efficient, and scalable systems for infrastructure management. The goal is to demonstrate how leveraging open-source tools, automation, and security best practices on Linux can optimize infrastructure performance while maintaining high levels of security.

# Key Features
Linux is the industry standard for infrastructure because of its unmatched performance, flexibility, and affordability. But it takes more than just understanding a few shell commands to effectively manage Linux-based settings. You must make sure:

- Security: Protect your systems from ever-evolving threats.
- Performance: Optimize resources for speed and scalability.
- Reliability: Keep your infrastructure running smoothly under any circumstances.

# Prerequisite
- EC2 Instance to SSH into
- Basic Linux Knowledge
- Terminal Access.
